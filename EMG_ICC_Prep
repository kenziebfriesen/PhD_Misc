%Reorganize EMG Data: Find Average of 3 Muscle On Times

%Read in data
%Find mean of columns 3 and 4 beginning row 10
%Divide every cell in columns 3 and 4 by mean
%Find absolute value of each cell: Rectify
%Find events
%Find average value of cells between events 1-2, 3-4, 5-6
%Find average of thee averages
%Report in row for each participant's set of 24 trials

%%%%

Data = dir('*.xlsm'); %Read in data
numFiles = length(Data); %Find number of data files
fileMaster = char({Data.name}); %Find order of output

%%%%

numEvents = 6; %number of events

                    variableData(rowNum, :) = correctedEMG(i, :); %Creating variableData using all rows of our datasheet (correctedEMG)
                    rowNum = rowNum + 1; %repeat for the next row
