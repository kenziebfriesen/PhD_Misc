%% Check Event Mark Placement

% Author: Kenzie Friesen
% Date: August 3, 2020
% Purpose: To verify that there are 5 EMs and that "Follow-through" is 24
% frames after "Ball Release"
% Event Mark is in column 71

clear all; clc;
Data = dir('*.txt'); %Read in data
numFiles = length(Data); %Find number of data files
fileMaster = char({Data.name}); %Find order of output

% Alter number of events
numEvents = 5; %number of events

% Needed for loop
master = []; %Creating master array for final output excel spreadsheet
f = 1; %file
p = 1; %participant
rowHold = numEvents + 1; %creating a rows of space
numParticipants = (numFiles)/3; % numParticipants based on how many files are in current folder divided by number of files per participant
j = 1;
d = 1;

for f = 1:numFiles
     filename = fileMaster(f, :); %Retrieves whole (:) file name for which you are working on
     num = readtable(filename); %Separates number and text values within a file
      currentTrial = num; %Current trial we are going to do work on is using only number data
      [rowsTrial, columnsTrial] = size(currentTrial); %Finds the  # of rows, columns in the trial we are working on "currentTrial"
      currentTrial = currentTrial(1:rowsTrial, 1:71); 
      [rowsTrial, columnsTrial] = size(currentTrial); %Re-sizes the currentTrial based on the row above specifications
      
% Needed to find events
      rowNum = 1; %A coutner used to let us know where we are in the matrix
      variableData = zeros(rowHold,71); %It is a temporary matrix for each event. Adds zeros to the matrix "variableData"
      i = 1; %Counter variable for the next while statement
      currentTrial = table2array(currentTrial);
      
%Find events
 while i < rowsTrial %repeat for every row of data
                if currentTrial(i, 71) == 1 %Using 3 bc thats the # of columns we have 
                    variableData(rowNum, :) = currentTrial(i, :); %Creating variableData using all rows of our datasheet (correctedEMG)
                    rowNum = rowNum + 1; %repeat for the next row
                    i = i + 1; 
                end
                if currentTrial(i, 71) ~= 1 %if correctedEMG doesn't equal 1
                    i = i + 1; %just move onto the next row of data
                end
 end

 %create master full of event marks
 master(j:(j+5),2:72) = variableData(:,:);
 master(j:j+5) = f;
 
 
 j = j+6;
 f = f +1; %Repeat for the next file
 
end
