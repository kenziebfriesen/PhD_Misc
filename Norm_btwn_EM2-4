function [Sub1P1_100] = whole_norm100(SubP_VEMdata,SubPdata)

% Function used to normalize data to 101 data points between event mark #2 and #4
% SubP_VEMdata is the column of data that contains event marks (denoted as ones)
% SubPdata is the data that is being normalized to 101 points

EventsSub1P1=find(SubP_VEMdata == 1);

% Then find the size between EM1 and 5
SizeE1E5=EventsSub1P1(4)-EventsSub1P1(2);

% Then using the linspace function I can evenly distribute each column of data
A=round(linspace(EventsSub1P1(2),EventsSub1P1(4),101));

% Do this for each column and place into new array
Sub1P1_100=SubPdata(A,:);
